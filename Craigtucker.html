    <h2><strong><u>Craig Tucker</u></strong></h2>
    is a member of the boys' fourth grade class. Craig's most distinguishing physical feature is
    his blue chullo hat topped with a yellow puffball. One of his traits is his compulsive tendency
    to flip people off, usually for no discernible reason. He leads the group known as Craig's Gang (aka Craig and those guys).
    He is one of the two children (along with Tweek Tweak) who are openly gay.
    While eight years old in the first three seasons, he was nine years old by "Fourth Grade",
    and as of the Season Twelve episode "Pandemic 2: The Startling", he is ten years old,
    according to the candles on his birthday cake. He also speaks with a rather deep voice,
    which is unusual for a child at his age.
