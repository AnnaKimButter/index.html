    <h2><strong><u>Tweek's Prominence</u></strong></h2>
    Although Tweek has fewer speaking roles than other background characters such as Craig or Clyde,
    he generally plays a larger role in the episodes in which he does appear.
    In the Season 6 episodes "The Simpsons Already Did It", "Red Hot Catholic Love", "Free Hat",
    "Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society", and "Child Abduction is Not Funny", he replaces Butters (who in turn replaced Kenny)
    as the fourth friend.
    Following the episode "Child Abduction is Not Funny", Tweek stopped appearing as part of the main group,
    due primarily to Kenny's re-introduction, first as a spirit sharing Cartman's body,
    and later when he was brought back permanently in "Red Sleigh Down". He has made several background appearances
    but does not have another major role until the episode "Tweek x Craig," in Season Nineteen.
