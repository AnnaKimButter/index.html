    <h2><strong><u>Tweek Tweek</u></strong></h2>
    is a student at South Park Elementary. He drinks lots of coffee, which causes paranoia and jittery muscle spasms.
    He made his first appearance in the Season Two episode, <a href="https://blog.naver.com/hgw2612/220222234260" target="_blank" title="S2 episode">Gnomes</a>, where it focused around him and The Boys doing a class project together.

    <br><br><h3><u>BackGround</u></h3><p>His next major appearance was in "Tweek vs. Craig" where he and Craig Tucker were pitted against each other in a fight by the other children for amusement. He was later brought into the main group from the Season Six episodes "Professor Chaos" to "Child Abduction is Not Funny". He was mostly used as a background character after leaving The Boys group in Season Six but continues to make frequent appearances and have speaking roles in the series from time to time. He is still in the extended group, Coon and Friends.</p>

    <h3><p><u>Criminal Record</u></p></h3><p><strong>*Indecent exposure</strong>: During the Weiners Out Movement of Season Twenty, he joins Butters' cause and frequently exposes his genitals.
    <br><br><strong>*Sexual Harassment (Alleged)</strong>: In "Sexual Harassment Panda", Mr. Mackey sued Tweek for commenting on the shape of his butt.
    <br><br><strong>*Assault</strong>: In Tweek vs. Craig, Tweek beats up Craig and vice versa, and they later fight again in the hospital.</p>

    <h3><p><u>Sexuality</u></p></h3><p>Beginning with "Tweek x Craig", Tweek is allegedly in a relationship with Craig Tucker. In "Wieners Out", Butters refers to the two as a gay couple when encouraging his male peers to join his movement. Despite their relationship being forced at the start, the two stay together of their own free will and are now more open about their sexualities and their relationship. In "Put It Down", Craig Tucker refers to Tweek as "honey" and "babe" even when not in front of other people. Assuming this means that they are actually in a relationship and they are not actually faking for publicity.</p>
